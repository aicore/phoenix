## worker/IndexingWorker

Phoenix houses a file indexing worker which caches all cacheable files of a project in memory.
This module can be used to communicate with the Index and extend it by attaching new js worker scripts to the
indexing worker as discussed below. Any extension that works on a large number of files should use the indexing
worker cache to free up the main thread of heavy computation.

## Import

```js
// usage within extensions:
const IndexingWorker = brackets.getModule("worker/IndexingWorker");
```

## Extending the indexing worker

You can add your own custom scripts to the indexing worker by following the below example. Suppose you have an
extension folder with the following structure:

    myExtensionFolder
    │  my_worker.js // the script that you need to attach to the web worker
    │  main.js

In `main.js` extension module, we can import `my_worker.js` script into `IndexingWorker` by:

```js
let ExtensionUtils = brackets.getModule("utils/ExtensionUtils");
let workerPath = ExtensionUtils.getModulePath(module, "my_worker.js")
IndexingWorker.loadScriptInWorker(workerPath);
```

Once the worker script is loaded with the above step, we can communicate with it using the either `IndexingWorker`
reference within Phoenix or the global `WorkerComm` reference within the Indexing worker.
All utility methods in module [worker/WorkerComm][1] can be used for worker communication.

NB: You can use all util methods available in `worker/WorkerComm` as `IndexingWorker` internally uses `WorkerComm`
to communicate with the underlying worker thread.

## WorkerComm-APIS

To communicate between the IndexingWorker and Phoenix, the following methods are available:
`loadScriptInWorker`, `execPeer`, `setExecHandler`, `triggerPeer` and other APIs described
in module `worker/WorkerComm`.
The above methods can be used with either `IndexingWorker` reference within Phoenix
or the global `WorkerComm` reference within the Indexing worker. (See example below.)

See [worker/WorkerComm][1] for detailed API docs.

### Examples

To Execute a named function `sayHello` in the worker from phoenix

```javascript
// in my_worker.js
WorkerComm.setExecHandler("sayHello", (arg)=>{
    console.log("hello from worker ", arg); // prints "hello from worker phoenix"
    return "Hello Phoenix";
  });
// In Phoenix/extension
let workerMessage = await IndexingWorker.execPeer("sayHello", "phoenix");
console.log(workerMessage); // prints "Hello Phoenix"
```

## EVENT_CRAWL_STARTED

Raised when crawling started in the indexing worker.

Type: null

## EVENT_CRAWL_PROGRESS

Raised when crawling in progressing within the worker. The handler will receive the
following properties as parameter.

Type: [object][2]

### Properties

*   `processed` **[number][3]** The number of files cached till now.
*   `total` **[number][3]** Number of files to cache.

## EVENT_CRAWL_COMPLETE

Raised when crawling is complete within the worker. The handler will receive the
following properties as parameter.

Type: [object][2]

### Properties

*   `numFilesCached` **[number][3]** 
*   `cacheSizeBytes` **[number][3]** 
*   `crawlTimeMs` **[number][3]** in milliseconds.
