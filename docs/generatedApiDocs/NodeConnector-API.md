## NodeConnector

Use this module to communicate easily with node and vice versa. A `NodeConnector` is an intermediary between a
module in node and a module in phcode. With a `NodeConnector` interface, you can execute a function in node
from phoenix by simply calling `await nodeConnectorObject.execPeer("namedFunctionInNodeModule, argObject")` and
the resolved promise will have the result. No need to do any complex IPC or anything else. See a step by step
example below on how this is done.

## The setup

Assume that you have a module in phcode `x.js` and another module in node `y.js`. To communicate between `x` and `y`
we have to first create a `NodeConnector` on both sides. A `NodeConnector` will have a unique ID that will be
same in both sides. In this example, lets set the id as `ext_x_y` where `ext` is your extension id to prevent
name collision with other extensions. Phoenix core reserves the prefix `ph_` for internal use.

### Create `NodeConnector` in Phoenix side `x.js`

```js
const NodeConnector = require('NodeConnector');
const XY_NODE_CONNECTOR_ID = 'ext_x_y';
let nodeConnector;
const nodeConnectedPromise = NodeConnector.createNodeConnector(XY_NODE_CONNECTOR_ID, exports).then(connector=>{
 nodeConnector = connector;
});

exports.modifyImage = async functions(imageName, imageArrayBugger){
  // do some image ops with the imageArrayBugger
  // to return an arry buffer, you should return an object that contains a key `buffer` with the `ArrayBuffer` contents.
  return {
    operationDone: "colored,cropped",
    buffer: imageArrayBugger
  };
};
```

### Create `NodeConnector` in Node `y.js`

```js
const XY_NODE_CONNECTOR_ID = 'ext_x_y';
let nodeConnector;
const nodeConnectedPromise = global.createNodeConnector(XY_NODE_CONNECTOR_ID, exports).then(connector=>{
 nodeConnector = connector;
});

exports.getPWDRelative = async functions(subPath){
  return process.cwd + "/" + subPath;
};
```

After the above, a node connector is now setup and available to use for 2 way communication.

## Executing Functions in Node from Phcode.

Suppose that you need to execute a function `getPWDRelative` in node module `y` from Phoenix.
Note that functions that are called with `execPeer` must be async and only takes a single argument.
A second optional argument can be passed which should be an ArrayBuffer to transfer large binary data(See below.).

### Calling `y.getPWDRelative` node module function from phoenix module `x.js`

```js
// in x.js
// treat it like just any other function call. The internal RPC bits are handled by the NodeConnector.
// This makes working with node APIs very eazy in phcode.
// ensure that `nodeConnector` is set before using it here as it is returned by a promise!
await nodeConnectedPromise;
const fullPath = await nodeConnector.execPeer('getPWDRelative', "sub/path.html");
```

## Executing Functions in Phcode from Node and sending binary data.

`execPeer` API accepts a single optional binary data that can be passed to the other side. In this example, we
will transfer an ArrayBuffer from node to phcode function `modifyImage` in module `x.js`

### Calling `x.modifyImage` phoenix module function from node module `y.js`

```js
// in y.js
// ensure that `nodeConnector` is set before using it here as it is returned by a promise!
await nodeConnectedPromise;
const {operationDone, buffer} = await nodeConnector.execPeer('modifyImage', "theHills.png", imageAsArrayBuffer);
```

## Events - Listening to and raising events between node and phoenix `NodeConnector`.

The nodeConnector object is an `EventDispatcher` implementing all the apis supported by `utils.EventDispatcher` API.
You can use `nodeConnector.triggerPeer(eventName, data, optionalArrayBuffer)` API to trigger an event on the other side.

### using `nodeConnector.triggerPeer(eventName, data, optionalArrayBuffer)`

Lets listen to a named `phoenixProjectOpened` event in node that will be raised from phoenix.

In `y.js` in node

```js
// in y.js
// ensure that `nodeConnector` is set before using it here as it is returned by a promise!
nodeConnector.on('phoenixProjectOpened', (_event, projectPath)={
  console.log(projectPath);
});
```

Now in Phoenix module `x.js`, we can raise the event on node by using the `triggerPeer` API.

```js
// in x.js
nodeConnector.triggerPeer("phoenixProjectOpened", "/x/project/folder");
// this will now trigger the event in node.
```

To listen, unlisten and see more operations of event handling available in `nodeConnector`, see docs for
`utils/EventDispatcher` module.

### Sending binary data in events

You can optionally send binary data with `triggerPeer`. See Eg. Below.

```js
nodeConnector.triggerPeer("imageEdited", "name.png", imageArrayBuffer);
```

## createNodeConnector

Creates a new node connector with the specified ID and module exports.

Returns a promise that resolves to an NodeConnector Object (which is an EventDispatcher with
additional `execPeer` and `triggerPeer` methods. `peer` here means, if you are executing `execPeer`
in Phoenix, it will execute the named function in node side, and vice versa.
The promise will be resolved only after a call to `createNodeConnector` on the other side with the
same `nodeConnectorID` is made. This is so that once the  promise is resolved, you can right away start
two-way communication (exec function, send/receive events) with the other side.

*   execPeer: A function that executes a peer function with specified parameters.
*   triggerPeer: A function that triggers an event to be sent to a peer.
*   Also contains all the APIs supported by `utils/EventDispatcher` module.

### Parameters

*   `nodeConnectorID` **[string][1]** The unique identifier for the new node connector.
*   `moduleExports` **[Object][2]** The exports of the module that contains the functions to be executed on the other side.

<!---->

*   Throws **[Error][3]** If a node connector with the same ID already exists.

Returns **[Promise][4]** A promise that resolves to an NodeConnector Object.
