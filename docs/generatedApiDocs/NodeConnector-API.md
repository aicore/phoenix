## NodeConnector

Node Connector Communication Module

This module simplifies communication between Node.js and Phoenix (phcode). A `NodeConnector` acts as an intermediary,
allowing you to execute functions in Node.js from Phoenix and vice versa. You can use the `execPeer` method to call
functions on the other side and handle communication seamlessly. Use `triggerPeer` to trigger events
on the other side.

## Setting Up a `NodeConnector`

To establish communication between two modules, such as `x.js` in Phoenix and `y.js` in Node.js, follow these steps:

### Create `NodeConnector` in Phoenix (`x.js`)

```js
const NodeConnector = require('NodeConnector');
const XY_NODE_CONNECTOR_ID = 'ext_x_y'; // Use a unique ID
let nodeConnector;

const nodeConnectedPromise = NodeConnector.createNodeConnector(XY_NODE_CONNECTOR_ID, exports).then(connector => {
  nodeConnector = connector;
});

exports.modifyImage = async function(imageName, imageArrayBuffer) {
  // Perform image operations with the imageArrayBuffer
  // To return an ArrayBuffer, return an object with a `buffer` key.
  return {
    operationDone: 'colored, cropped',
    buffer: imageArrayBuffer,
  };
};
```

### Create `NodeConnector` in Node.js (`y.js`)

```js
const XY_NODE_CONNECTOR_ID = 'ext_x_y'; // Use the same unique ID
let nodeConnector;

const nodeConnectedPromise = global.createNodeConnector(XY_NODE_CONNECTOR_ID, exports).then(connector => {
  nodeConnector = connector;
});

exports.getPWDRelative = async function(subPath) {
  return process.cwd + '/' + subPath;
};
```

With these steps, a `NodeConnector` is set up, enabling two-way communication.

## Executing Functions

To call a Node.js function from Phoenix, use the `execPeer` method. Ensure that `nodeConnector` is set before using it.

```js
// In `x.js` (Phoenix)
await nodeConnectedPromise;
const fullPath = await nodeConnector.execPeer('getPWDRelative', 'sub/path.html');
```

To execute a Phoenix function from Node.js and transfer binary data, pass an optional ArrayBuffer.

```js
// In `y.js` (Node.js)
await nodeConnectedPromise;
const { operationDone, buffer } = await nodeConnector.execPeer('modifyImage', {name:'theHills.png'}, imageAsArrayBuffer);
```

## Event Handling

The `NodeConnector` object implements all the APIs supported by `utils/EventDispatcher`. You can trigger and listen
to events between Node.js and Phoenix using the `triggerPeer` and `on` methods.

```js
// In `y.js` (Node.js)
nodeConnector.on('phoenixProjectOpened', (_event, projectPath) => {
  console.log(projectPath);
});
```

To raise an event from Phoenix to Node.js:

```js
// In `x.js` (Phoenix)
nodeConnector.triggerPeer('phoenixProjectOpened', '/x/project/folder');
```

To Switch off events

```js
nodeConnector.off('phoenixProjectOpened'); // will switch off all event handlers of that name.
```

To selectively switch off event handlers, please see reference for `utils/EventDispatcher` module.

### Handling ArrayBuffer Data in Function Execution

When executing functions that send or receive binary data, ensure that the functions are asynchronous and accept an
optional ArrayBuffer as a parameter. To return binary data, use an object with a `buffer` key.

Example of calling a function in Node.js with binary data transfer:

```js
// In `y.js` (Node.js)
await nodeConnectedPromise;
const { operationDone, buffer } = await nodeConnector.execPeer('modifyImage', {name:'name.png'}, imageArrayBuffer);
```

### Handling ArrayBuffer Data in Event Handling

Use the `triggerPeer` method to send binary data in events. Include the ArrayBuffer as an optional parameter.

Example of sending binary data in an event from Phoenix to Node.js:

```js
// In `x.js` (Phoenix)
const imageArrayBuffer = getSomeImageArrayBuffer(); // Get the ArrayBuffer
nodeConnector.triggerPeer('imageEdited', 'name.png', imageArrayBuffer);
```

*   ## Caveats

<!---->

*   Ensure that the `nodeConnectedPromise` is resolved before using the `nodeConnector` to avoid potential issues
    related to communication readiness.
*   Be cautious when sending large binary data, as it may affect performance and memory usage.
*   Properly handle exceptions and errors when executing functions to maintain robust communication.
*   Functions called with `execPeer` and `triggerPeer` must be asynchronous and accept a single argument. An optional
    second argument can be used to transfer large binary data as an ArrayBuffer.

For more event handling operations and details, refer to the documentation for the `utils/EventDispatcher` module.

## createNodeConnector

Creates a new node connector with the specified ID and module exports.

Returns a promise that resolves to an NodeConnector Object (which is an EventDispatcher with
additional `execPeer` and `triggerPeer` methods. `peer` here means, if you are executing `execPeer`
in Phoenix, it will execute the named function in node side, and vice versa.
The promise will be resolved only after a call to `createNodeConnector` on the other side with the
same `nodeConnectorID` is made. This is so that once the  promise is resolved, you can right away start
two-way communication (exec function, send/receive events) with the other side.

*   execPeer: A function that executes a peer function with specified parameters.
*   triggerPeer: A function that triggers an event to be sent to a peer.
*   Also contains all the APIs supported by `utils/EventDispatcher` module.

### Parameters

*   `nodeConnectorID` **[string][1]** The unique identifier for the new node connector.
*   `moduleExports` **[Object][2]** The exports of the module that contains the functions to be executed on the other side.

<!---->

*   Throws **[Error][3]** If a node connector with the same ID already exists.

Returns **[Promise][4]** A promise that resolves to an NodeConnector Object.
