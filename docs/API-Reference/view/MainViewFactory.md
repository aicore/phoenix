## \_
MainViewFactory is a singleton for managing view factories.Registering a view factory:```js     registerViewFactory({          canOpenFile: function (fullPath) {              return (fullPath.slice(-4) === ".ico");          },          openFile: function(file, pane) {              return createIconView(file, pane);          }     });``` The openFile method is used to open the file and construct a view of it.  Implementation should add the view to the pane```js     function createIconView(file, pane) {         // IconView will construct its DOM and append         //  it to pane.$el         var view = new IconView(file, pane.$el);         // Then tell the pane to add it to         //  its view map and show it         pane.addView(view, true);         return new $.Deferred().resolve().promise();     }``` Factories should only create 1 view of a file per pane.  Brackets currently only supports 1 view of a file open at a given time but that may change to allow the same file open in more than 1 pane. Therefore Factories can do a simple check to see if a view already exists and show it before creating a new one:```js     var view = pane.getViewForPath(file.fullPath);     if (view) {         pane.showView(view);     } else {         return createIconView(file, pane);     }```
