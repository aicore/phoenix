### Import :
```js
const MainViewManager = brackets.getModule("view/MainViewManager")
```

<a name="_"></a>

## \_
MainViewManager manages the arrangement of all open panes as well as provides the controller
logic behind all views in the MainView (e.g. ensuring that a file doesn't appear in 2 lists)

Each pane contains one or more views wich are created by a view factory and inserted into a pane list.
There may be several panes managed by the MainViewManager with each pane containing a list of views.
The panes are always visible and the layout is determined by the MainViewManager and the user.

Currently we support only 2 panes.

All of the WorkingSet APIs take a paneId Argument.  This can be an actual pane Id, ALL_PANES (in most cases)
or ACTIVE_PANE. ALL_PANES may not be supported for some APIs.  See the API for details.

This module dispatches several events:

   - activePaneChange - When the active pane changes.  There will always be an active pane.
         (e, newPaneId:string, oldPaneId:string)
   - currentFileChange -- When the user has switched to another pane, file, document. When the user closes a view
     and there are no other views to show the current file will be null.
         (e, newFile:File, newPaneId:string, oldFile:File, oldPaneId:string)
   - paneLayoutChange -- When Orientation changes.
         (e, orientation:string)
   - paneCreate -- When a pane is created
         (e, paneId:string)
   - paneDestroy -- When a pane is destroyed
         (e, paneId:string)


   To listen for working set changes, you must listen to *all* of these events:
   - workingSetAdd -- When a file is added to the working set
         (e, fileAdded:File, index:number, paneId:string)
   - workingSetAddList -- When multiple files are added to the working set
         (e, fileAdded:Array."File", paneId:string)
   - workingSetMove - When a File has moved to a different working set
         (e, File:FILE, sourcePaneId:string, destinationPaneId:string)
   - workingSetRemove -- When a file is removed from the working set
         (e, fileRemoved:File, suppressRedraw:boolean, paneId:string)
   - workingSetRemoveList -- When multiple files are removed from the working set
         (e, filesRemoved:Array."File", paneId:string)
   - workingSetSort -- When a pane's view array is reordered without additions or removals.
         (e, paneId:string)
   - workingSetUpdate -- When changes happen due to system events such as a file being deleted.
                             listeners should discard all working set info and rebuilt it from the pane
                             by calling getWorkingSet()
         (e, paneId:string)
   - _workingSetDisableAutoSort -- When the working set is reordered by manually dragging a file.
         (e, paneId:string) For Internal Use Only.

To listen for events, do something like this: (see EventDispatcher for details on this pattern)
   `MainViewManager.on("eventname", handler);`
