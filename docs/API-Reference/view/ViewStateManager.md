ViewStateManager is a singleton for views to park their global viwe state. The state is savedwith project data but the View or View Factory is responsible for restoring the view statewhen the view is created.Views should implement `getViewState()` so that the view state can be saved and that data is cachedfor later use.Views or View Factories are responsible for restoring the view state when the view of that file is createdby recalling the cached state.  Views determine what data is store in the view state and how to restore it.
